# Morland Catchment Information System (CIS)

This repository contains an Excel-based catchment decision support tool developed during my master’s studies in Europe.  
The tool allows users to explore how **land-use change** and **climate change scenarios** affect hydrologic response using an Excel model with VBA automation.

This project was developed as part of a collaborative master’s-level coursework project in Europe.
